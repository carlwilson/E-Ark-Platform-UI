#Order management module

The Order Management Tool enables archivists to review incoming orders, package IPs containing archival records from those orders, and make the IPs available for end-users. Features include:

* A list of orders from end-users. The list displays the status of individual orders and can be sorted in various ways.
* Detail view of individual orders. Ordered archival records are listed here and archivists can do various actions on the order.
* A feature to “process” orders, ie. build and index new IPs containing the requested archival records.
* Once “pre-processed”, an order can be manually customised by the archivist by copying and moving files in the IP.
* Automatic update of order status once an IP is made available to the end-user. This tells the end-user that an order is ready for viewing.
