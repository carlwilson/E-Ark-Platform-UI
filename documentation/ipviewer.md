#IP viewer module

The IP Viewer enables archivists and end-users to browse, search, view, and download archival records. The IP Viewer is used in read-only mode for letting end-users view archival records in finalized IPs and in edit mode for letting archivists prepare IPs for dissemination. Features include:

* File tree and breadcrumb path for navigation support.
* Detail view of individual archival records with option to preview or download files.
* View metadata of selected items in the IP.
* Search archival records within the IP.
* Add folders, copy and delete files (edit mode for archivists only).
