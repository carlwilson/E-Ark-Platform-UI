#User interaction overview

In a typical use case, an end-user will login to the Access Software Platform and search for available archival records. When the end-user finds the titles of one or more interesting archival records, he or she can request full access to them by creating an order for them. He or she can now log off and wait for the order to be processed.

Later, an archivist will login to the Access Software Platform and notice the new order in a list of incoming orders. He or she will review the requested archival records and decide to make the them available by creating an IP containing them. Once the DIP is created and indexed, the original order’s status is set to “ready”.

As the end-user logs in to check on the progress of an order, he or she will see that the order has a new status, “ready”. From the order list, selecting an individual order will display the order details, including a link to the DIP that the archivist created for the user. The end-user can now browse the requested archival records, see their details, preview them, and download for later use.
