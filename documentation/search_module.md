#Search Module

The search module enables users to search for records that can potentially be made available and order them for later review. Features include:

* Search interface for documents with Solr combined search features (AND, OR, NOT). Users can view available metadata for archival records in the search result list.
* Picking out archival records from a search result and collecting them into an order using a shopping basket feature. Once collected, orders can be sent along with some comments to the archivists. 
* A list of current and previous orders. Users are able to see the status of individual orders using this list.

As of now it is possible to identify to which IP an archival record belongs by inspecting its metadata and viewing the IP’s ID. It is also possible to identify its relative place - to which descriptive unit does it belong? -  in an IP’s hierarchy (if applicable) by inspecting the c-level of the archival record i question.
